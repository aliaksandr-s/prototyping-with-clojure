# From an Idea to a working Prototype using Clojure and Clojurescript.

## Introduction

This series of tutorials is supposed to show you how to turn your ideas into working prototypes and create a fullstack application using Clojure and Clojurescript. We will go through all the steps: wireframing, back-end and front-end development, testing and deployment. These tutorials assume that you have some prior programming experience and have some familiarity with Clojure or any other LISP-like language. If something like that expression `(+ 1 1)` looks intimidating to you I'd suggest starting from a great book for beginners [Clojure for the Brave and True][brave-clojure].
