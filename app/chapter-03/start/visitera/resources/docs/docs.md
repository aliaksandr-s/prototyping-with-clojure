<h2 class="alert alert-success">Congratulations, your <a class="alert-link" href="http://luminusweb.net">Luminus</a> site is ready!</h2>

This page will help guide you through the first steps of building your site.

#### Why are you seeing this page?

The `home-routes` handler in the `visitera.routes.home` namespace
defines the route that invokes the `home-page` function whenever an HTTP
request is made to the `/` URI using the `GET` method.

```
(defn home-routes []
  [""
   {:middleware [middleware/wrap-csrf
                 middleware/wrap-formats]}
   ["/" {:get home-page}]
   ["/docs" {:get (fn [_]
                    (-> (response/ok (-> "docs/docs.md" io/resource slurp))
                        (response/header "Content-Type" "text/plain; charset=utf-8")))}]])
```

The `home-page` function will in turn call the `visitera.layout/render` function
to render the HTML content:

```
(defn home-page [_]
  (layout/render "home.html"))
```

The page contains a link to the compiled ClojureScript found in the `target/cljsbuild/public` folder:

```
{% script "/js/app.js" %}
```

The rest of this page is rendered by ClojureScript found in the `src/cljs/visitera/core.cljs` file.



#### Organizing the routes

The routes are aggregated and wrapped with middleware in the `visitera.handler` namespace:

```
(mount/defstate app
  :start
  (middleware/wrap-base
    (ring/ring-handler
      (ring/router
        [(home-routes)])
      (ring/routes
        (ring/create-resource-handler
          {:path "/"})
        (wrap-content-type
          (wrap-webjars (constantly nil)))
        (ring/create-default-handler
          {:not-found
           (constantly (error-page {:status 404, :title "404 - Page not found"}))
           :method-not-allowed
           (constantly (error-page {:status 405, :title "405 - Not allowed"}))
           :not-acceptable
           (constantly (error-page {:status 406, :title "406 - Not acceptable"}))})))))
```

The `app` definition groups all the routes in the application into a single handler.
A default route group is added to handle the `404`, `405`, and `406` errors.

#### Managing your middleware

Request middleware functions are located under the `visitera.middleware` namespace.

This namespace is reserved for any custom middleware for the application. Some default middleware is
already defined here. The middleware is assembled in the `wrap-base` function.

Middleware used for development is placed in the `visitera.dev-middleware` namespace found in
the `env/dev/clj/` source path.
