# Data modeling

In this chapter we'll be working with the core part of our application: the database. We need to create a schema for our database and populate it with countires data. 

Code for the beggining of this chapter can be found in  `app/chapter-04/start` folder.

## Preparation

Before we can start working on a schema there are some preparations to make. To conviniently experiment with schema modeling we need a function to reset a database and we want the ability to run it without restarting the whole application. 

But first let's have a look at another way of starting the application. In the previous chapter we used `$ lein run` command which executed `start-app` function from `visitera.core` namespace and run REPL for us. Then we just connected to a running REPL.

Now let's first try to run a REPL using `$ lein repl` command. Then run `(start)`. Now we should have a running app and REPL where we can enter other commands. Let's try to execute `(stop)` command. Now our app is stopped but we still have our REPL. 

That's pretty cool and gives us more flexiblity. But where do these `(start)` and `(stop)` commands come from? That's a good question. All these commands belong to `user` namespace which is located in `/env/dev/clj/user.clj` file. Here its content:

```clojure
(ns user
  "Userspace functions you can run by default in your local REPL."
  (:require
    [visitera.config :refer [env]]
    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
    [expound.alpha :as expound]
    [mount.core :as mount]
    [visitera.figwheel :refer [start-fw stop-fw cljs]]
    [visitera.core :refer [start-app]]))

(alter-var-root #'s/*explain-out* (constantly expound/printer))

(add-tap (bound-fn* clojure.pprint/pprint))

(defn start 
  "Starts application.
  You'll usually want to run this on startup."
  []
  (mount/start-without #'visitera.core/repl-server))

(defn stop 
  "Stops application."
  []
  (mount/stop-except #'visitera.core/repl-server))

(defn restart 
  "Restarts application."
  []
  (stop)
  (start))
```
We'll add a function to reset a database here in a bit. But first let's create a fuction to delete a database in `visitera.db.core` namespace. 

```clojure
(defn delete-database
  []
  (-> env :database-url d/delete-database))
```
Don't forget to import `env` from `visitera.config`

```clojure
[visitera.config :refer [env]]
```

Now we can create a `reset-db` function in `user` namespace. It just deletes a database and restrarts our application. We also added `(install-schema conn)` to `start` function as we did in previous chapter with `visitera.core` namespace. Here's an updated file:

```clojure
(ns user
  "Userspace functions you can run by default in your local REPL."
  (:require
   [visitera.config :refer [env]]
   [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
   [expound.alpha :as expound]
   [mount.core :as mount]
   [visitera.figwheel :refer [start-fw stop-fw cljs]]
   [visitera.core :refer [start-app]]
   [visitera.db.core :refer [conn install-schema delete-database]]))

(alter-var-root #'s/*explain-out* (constantly expound/printer))

(add-tap (bound-fn* clojure.pprint/pprint))

(defn start 
  "Starts application.
  You'll usually want to run this on startup."
  []
  (mount/start-without #'visitera.core/repl-server)
  (install-schema conn))

(defn stop 
  "Stops application."
  []
  (mount/stop-except #'visitera.core/repl-server))

(defn restart 
  "Restarts application."
  []
  (stop)
  (start))

(defn reset-db
  "Delete database and restart application"
  []
  (delete-database)
  (restart))
```

Now let's restart our REPL. We can stop it with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> command. Then `$ lein repl` and `(start)`. Now we can try to execute `(reset-db)`. Everything should work, but let's verify to be sure. 

In the previous chapter we added `/db-test` route to `visitera.routes.home` namespace which just returns a name of a user with `abc` id which is equal to `Good Name A`
 
```clojure
["/db-test" {:get (fn [_]
                       (let [db (d/db conn)
                             user (find-user db "abc")]
                         (-> (response/ok (:user/name user))
                             (response/header "Content-Type" "text/plain; charset=utf-8"))))}]
```

So let's open `/resources/migrations/schema.edn` and change its name to something like `Bad Name B` or any other stupid name that you can imagine.

```clojure
{:user/id     "abc"
 :user/name   "Bad Name B"
 :user/email  "abc@example.com"
 :user/status :user.status/active}
```
Now simply run `(reset-db)` in our REPL and have a look at the result by the address `http://localhost:3000/db-test`
