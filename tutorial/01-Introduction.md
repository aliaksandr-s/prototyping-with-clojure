<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This series of tutorials is supposed to show you how to turn your ideas into working prototypes and create a fullstack application using Clojure and Clojurescript. We will go through all the steps: wireframing, back-end and front-end development, testing and deployment. These tutorials assume that you have some prior programming experience and have some familiarity with Clojure or any other LISP-like language. If something like that expression <code>(+ 1 1)</code> looks intimidating to you I’d suggest starting from a great book for begginers <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>. That’s probably enough for the intorduction. Hope you’ll enjoy that series.</p>
