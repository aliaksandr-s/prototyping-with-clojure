# Going live

Our application is finished and now it's time to make it live so everyone could try it out. In this chapter we will create a production build, then containerize our application for simpler deployment process, and set up a remote server with a custom domain. 

Code for the beginning of this chapter can be found in  `app/chapter-07/start` folder.
