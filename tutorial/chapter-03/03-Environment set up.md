# Environment set up

In this chapter we'll do all the necessary preparations before we can actually start coding. We'll install dependencies, scaffold the project, do some REPLing, set up our code editor.

## Installing dependencies

Clojure is a hosted language and it's beign compiled to JVM bytecode and then beign executed by JVM. And to work with it we should have `java` installed (for now it's recommended to use `java 8`). Then we need something for managing dependencies, handling versioning, and building our projects. And `Leiningen` should help us here. And the last thing we need to install is `Datomic`.

Here are the links where you can get everything:

 - [Java 8][java-download]
 - [Leiningen][lein-install]
 - [Datomic][datomic-download]

## Starting the project

Now that we have everything installed let's create a new project and verify that everything works. But first we need to run a database. Follow these steps to launch it:

1. Go to the folder where you installed it. 
2. Run that command: 

```bash
$ bin/transactor config/samples/free-transactor-template.properties
```

If everything is okay you should see something like that:

```bash
System started datomic:free://localhost:4334/<DB-NAME>
```

Now that we have a database running we can start our project. But I just realized that we don't have a name for it. Sure we can call it `myapp`, `testapp`, just `app` it actually doesn't matter but that would be too boring. So let's choose something more beautiful and meaningful. For example `visitera` sounds like a good name for me.  Now lets run the following command in a new terminal window:

```bash
$ lein new luminus visitera +datomic +re-frame +auth
```

It will scaffold a project for us with all the dependencies we need. Code for the project after this step will be in folder `app/chapter-3/start`.

Now lets go to a newly created directory and run the project. 

```bash
$ cd visitera
$ lein run
```

If everything went okay we should see these lines in the terminal:

```bash
server started on port 3000
starting nREPL server on port 7000
```

Let's go to `http://localhost:3000/` in our browser to see what we get.
We should see something like that:

```
Welcome to visitera

If you're seeing this message, that means you haven't yet compiled your ClojureScript!

Please run  lein figwheel  to start the ClojureScript compiler and reload the page.
```

We can see a response, that means our backend part is working. And that message says that we need to compile our clientside code to make it work. Let's run the suggestet command `lein figwheel` in a new terminal window and see what will happen. If everything went fine after refreshing the browser we should see a page with that phrase:

```
Congratulations, your Luminus site is ready!
```

Great! It seems everything is working. But we completely forgot about our database. We need to make sure that we can interract with it from our code. First we need to change some settings. Lets open `dev-config.edn` file. Here its content:

```clojure
{:dev true
 :port 3000
 ;; when :nrepl-port is set the application starts the nREPL server on load
 :nrepl-port 7000
 
 ; set your dev database connection URL here
 ; database-url "datomic:free://localhost:4334/visitera_dev"

 ; alternatively, you can use the datomic mem db for development:
 ; :database-url "datomic:mem://visitera_datomic_dev"
}
```

We need to uncomment this line:
 `database-url "datomic:free://localhost:4334/visitera_dev"`

Now let's have a look what we have inside `src` folder. There are three folders: 

1. `clj` - is for Clojure server-side code.  
2. `cljs` - is for ClojureScript client-side code.
3. `cljc` - is for shared code that can be used with Clojure and with ClojureScript.

For now we're interested only in `clj` folder and particularly in `/visitera/core.clj` and `visitera/db/core.clj`. It should be pretty obvious from the name that `visitera/db/core.clj` has everything related to interactions with the database. And `/visitera/core.clj` is our app entry-point it has `-main` function that will be called during a startup.
We need to install a db schema when we start our app so let's do some changes to `/visitera/core.clj`.

```clojure
(ns visitera.core
  (:require
   [visitera.handler :as handler]
   [visitera.nrepl :as nrepl]
   [luminus.http-server :as http]
   [visitera.config :refer [env]]
   [clojure.tools.cli :refer [parse-opts]]
   [clojure.tools.logging :as log]
   [mount.core :as mount]
   [visitera.db.core :refer [conn install-schema]])
  (:gen-class))
```

First we require `conn` and `install-schema` from `visitera.db.core` namespace.

```clojure
(defn start-app [args]
  (doseq [component (-> args
                        (parse-opts cli-options)
                        mount/start-with-args
                        :started)]
    (log/info component "started")
    (install-schema conn))
  (.addShutdownHook (Runtime/getRuntime) (Thread. stop-app)))
```

And then we add a call to `install-schema` inside `start-app` function.
The schema with some test data is located in `resources/migrations/schema.edn` file.

And the last thing we need to test a database interaction is a route that will get some data from the database and send it in a response back to the browser. Here are the changes we need to make to `src/clj/visitera/routes/home.clj`

```clojure
(ns visitera.routes.home
  (:require
   [visitera.layout :as layout]
   [clojure.java.io :as io]
   [visitera.middleware :as middleware]
   [ring.util.http-response :as response]
   [visitera.db.core :refer [conn find-user]]
   [datomic.api :as d]))

(defn home-page [request]
  (layout/render request "home.html"))

(defn home-routes []
  [""
   {:middleware [middleware/wrap-csrf
                 middleware/wrap-formats]}
   ["/" {:get home-page}]
   ["/db-test" {:get (fn [_]
                       (let [db (d/db conn)
                             user (find-user db "abc")]
                         (-> (response/ok (:user/name user))
                             (response/header "Content-Type" "text/plain; charset=utf-8"))))}]
   ["/docs" {:get (fn [_]
                    (-> (response/ok (-> "docs/docs.md" io/resource slurp))
                        (response/header "Content-Type" "text/plain; charset=utf-8")))}]])
```

First we require `conn` and `find-user` functions from `visitera.db.core` namespace. And also everything from `datomic.api` namespace as `d`.  Next we add a new `/db-test` route. Where we first retrieve value of the database for reading `(d/db conn)`. Next we get a user by its id `(find-user db "abc")`. User with that id is predefined in `resources/migrations/schema.edn` file. And the last part we just return that user name `(response/ok (:user/name user))`. 

Now it's time to test everything. First we should stop the terminal process where we run `lein run` using <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. And run 
it again. Now go to `http://localhost:3000/db-test` in your browser and you should see:
 
`Good Name A`

Great! Everything is working.

## Tryin REPL

We just created a new route to test if our database integration is working. But that's not really convenient. Is there a better way to do this? Yes, it is! Using REPL we can interactively test any part of our programm. So lets try it!

When we execute `lein run` we have our app started on port `3000` and our REPL running on port `7000`.

```bash
server started on port 3000
starting nREPL server on port 7000
``` 

Let's create a new terminal window and connect to REPL using that commnad:

```bash
$ lein repl :connect localhost:7000
```

We should see the prompt sign:

`user=>`

Here `user` represents a namespace we are currently in.  And now we can interract with our running programm. 
First let's enter our `visitera.db.core` namespace with that command:

```clojure
(in-ns 'visitera.db.core)
```

And then run the following command:

```clojure
(:user/name (let [db (d/db conn)]
   (find-user db "abc")))
```

You should get the same result: 

`"Good Name A"`

That's much more simple and convenient then making a call to server. We just interactively communicate with the database. I encourage you to play with it for a bit and try other functions (`add-user`, `show-transaction`, `find-one-by`) from the current namespace.

We also have another REPL on port `7002` to interact with our ClojureScript code and it's already beign started for us by `$ lein figwheel` command. Let's open that terminal window where we run that command. Our prompt should be like that:

`app:cljs.user=>`

First let's go to `http://localhost:3000/`. And then evaluate that expression in REPL:

```clojure
=> (set! (.-innerHTML (.getElementById js/document "app")) "Hello world!")
```

You should immediatelly see the result in your browser.  That shouldn't be so hard to understand what that code does. But if you're confused `.` is used to call methods on js objects and `.-` is for accessing properties.  You can try to use some commands from [ClojureScript Cheatsheet][cljs-cheatsheet] to get more practice.

## Setting up a text editor.

Using REPL gives us a really cool interactive development experience. But we can make it even better by integrating REPL to a text editor which will give us an extremely pleasurable development experience. Here I'll show how to do this using [VSCode][vs-code].  Basically all we need is to install [Calva][calva] extension. Now when we open our project in VSCode we should see an input on the top. If there is no input follow these steps: 

1.  Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> to get a command input
2. Type in `> Calva: Connect to a running REPL`
3. Then choose `Don't load any cljs supprot`
4. And specify adress with a port `localhost:7000`

Now we should have a REPL connected to our text editor. That means we can evaluate our code right under the cursor. Let's see how it works.

Open `src/clj/visitera/db/core.clj` file and add this line to the end of the file:

```clojure
(:user/name (find-user (d/db conn) "abc"))
```

Now you can put your cursor before any opening `(` or closing `)` parentheses
and run the command:

`> Calva: evaluate current form/selection inline and print to output`

All the code inside the parentheses will be evaluated and you should see the result immideatelly right in your text editor. I'd recommend setting up hotkeys for that command because you'll be using it a lot. 

To connect to ClojureScript REPL follow the same steps just on step 3 choose `Figwheel` and on step 4 port `7002`.

Clojure REPL is one of the best language features
