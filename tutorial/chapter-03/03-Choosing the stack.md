# Choosing the stack

In this chapter we're gonna decide what tools we're gonna use to build our app. And try to answer why we need those tools. 

## Choosing the tools

It should be clear from the series title that as a main language we'll be using **Clojure**. But besides the language itself we need a database to save our users trips.

And also we need a bunch of libraries to help us with authentication and authorization, routing, view rendering and state managament.
