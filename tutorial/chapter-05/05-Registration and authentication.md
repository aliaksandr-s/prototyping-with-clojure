# Registration and authentication

By now our app has a data layer so we can start working on our backed service. In this chapter we will have a look at some theory behind registration and authentication, implement routes and handlers and add some tests.

Code for the beginning of this chapter can be found in  `app/chapter-05/start` folder.

## Some theory

There are a lot of different ways to implement authentication in modern web applications: session, JWT, oauth2. For our app we'll go with the simplest one: session based authentication. 

The authentication process simply consists of checking the `:identity` keyword in session. And session is just a tiny piece of encoded data that being sent with every request from the client. On the client it's stored in cookies and its value will look something like that: `3be2b6e9-0973-4860-b97f-a0f143cc1d8a`. On the server it will be decoded and we can get more sense out of it:  `{:identity :test@user.com}`. We'll get into more details when we start working with code.

## Registration

Let's start with registration. There is nothing fancy here: user goes to the `/register` route and gets a form which is rendered on the sever. There are two fields: email and password. User submits a form, we check it on the server: if everything is fine we create a user and redirect to `/login` page, if there are any validation errors we insert them into the form and return back to user. 

Here is a diagram of registration flow that shows all the details:

As the first step we obviously need to start the project:

 1. Go to datomic folder:  `$ cd {datomic-folder}`
 2. Run the transactor: `$ bin/transactor config/samples/free-transactor-template.properties`
 3. Go to project folder: `$ cd {project-folder}`
 4. Start REPL `$ lein repl`
 5. Start the project from REPL `user=> (start)` 

Next we need to create HTML templates. We'll have two forms: one for registration and another one for login. So to prevent copy-pasting we'll create one common HTML template and simply extend it with different forms.

```
  +-------------------+     +-------------------+
  |  auth.html        |     |  auth.html        |
  | +---------------+ |     | +---------------+ |
  | | register.html | |     | | login.html    | |
  | |               | |     | |               | |
  | +---------------+ |     | +---------------+ |
  +-------------------+     +-------------------+
```

Our app template already comes with [bulma css framework][bulma] preinstalled, so we don't need to worry about styling. And all the HTML templates are located in `resources/html` folder.

Here is the content of `auth.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Visitera</title>
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        {% style "/assets/bulma/css/bulma.min.css" %}
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="hero is-primary is-fullheight">
            <div class="hero-head">
                <nav class="navbar">
                    <div class="container">
                        <div class="navbar-brand">
                            <a href="/" class="navbar-item has-text-white" style="font-weight: bold;">VisiterA</a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </nav>
            </div>
            <div class="hero-body">
                <div class="hero-body">
                    <div class="container">
                        <div class="columns is-centered">
                            <div class="column is-5-tablet is-5-desktop
                                is-4-widescreen">
                                {% block form %}
                                {% endblock %}
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

In the head we include our css framework. And the next block we'll be replaced with the content of the form.

```html
{% block form %}
{% endblock %}
```

And here is our `register.html` with comments explaining the main parts:

```html
{% extends "auth.html" %}  <!--  here we specify what template to extend  -->
{% block form %}           <!--  a place in auth template where the next code will be injected -->
<form method="POST" action="/register" class="box"> 
    {% csrf-field %}       <!--  more about this here http://www.luminusweb.net/docs/security.html#cross_site_request_forgery_protection -->
    <label class="label is-medium has-text-centered">Create Account</label>
    <div class="field">
        <label for="email" class="label">Email</label>
        <div class="control has-icons-left">
            <!-- Make input red if any errors in validation. 
                 Also pass email back from the server so user wouldn't have to type it again -->
             <input type="text"
                   name="email"
                   placeholder="e.g.bobsmith@gmail.com"
                   class="input {% if errors.email %} is-danger {% endif %}"
                   value="{% if email %}{{email}}{% endif %}"
            />
           <span class="icon is-small is-left">
                <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>
            </span>
        </div>
        <!-- Show validation errors if any -->
        {% if errors.email %}
        <p class="help is-danger">{{errors.email}}</p>
        {% endif %}

   </div>
    <div class="field">
        <label for="password" class="label">Password</label>
        <div class="control has-icons-left">
            <input type="password"
                   name="password"
                   placeholder="*******"
                   class="input {% if errors.password %} is-danger {% endif %}"
 
            />
            <span class="icon is-small is-left">
                <i class="fa fa-lock"></i>
            </span>
        </div>
        {% if errors.password %}
        <p class="help is-danger">{{errors.password}}</p>
        {% endif %}
    </div>
   <div class="field">
        <button class="button is-success" style="width: 100%">
            Register
        </button>
    </div>
    <div class="field has-text-centered">
        <span>Already a user? <a href="/login">Log in</a></span>
    </div>
</form>
{% endblock %}
```

All the templates are ready so now we can add a function that will handle the rendering. Let's put the next piece of code to `src/clj/visitera/layout.clj` file:

```clojure
(defn register-page [request]
  (render
   request
   "register.html"))
``` 

Let's also move `home-page` function from `visitera.routes.home` namespace to `visitera.layout` namespace.

```clojure
(defn home-page [request]
  (render request "home.html"))
```

And the last part is adding route handler to our `visitera.routes.home` namespace, and removing everything we don't need. Here's how it should look like by now: 

```clojure
(ns visitera.routes.home
  (:require
   [visitera.layout :refer [register-page home-page]]
   [visitera.middleware :as middleware]
   [ring.util.http-response :as response]
   [visitera.db.core :refer [conn find-user]]
   [datomic.api :as d]))

(defn home-routes []
  [""
   {:middleware [middleware/wrap-csrf
                 middleware/wrap-formats]}
   ["/" {:get home-page}]
   ["/register" {:get register-page}]])
```

Now we can go to `http://localhost:3000/register` and have a look at our form. But there are a few issues with it right now: submitting obviously isn't working yet, and icons aren't shown. Let's fix the second one first. 

Icons aren't show because [bulma] uses [font-awesome] as a dependency. It's not coming preinstalled so we need to install it manually. First we go to [webjars] website, choose `Leiningen` as a build tool, and search for `font-awesome`. The first link should be the correct one, just the version may be different. For me it is: `org.webjars/font-awesome "5.9.0"`. Next we just add it to `:dependencies` in our `project.clj` file. 

```clojure
:dependencies [ ...
				[org.webjars/font-awesome "5.9.0"]
				...]
```

Then we can use `$ lein deps` command to install it explicitly and restart our app. Or just restart our app that will install all the dependencies implicitly:

 1. Stop: <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd>
 2. Start REPL: `$ lein repl`
 3. Run application: `=> (start)`

The last part is to add `.css` file to the head of `auth.html` template:

```html
<head>
     <title>Visitera</title>
     <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
     {% style "/assets/bulma/css/bulma.min.css" %}
     {% style "/assets/font-awesome/css/all.css" %}
</head>
```

Now we should be able to see nice icons of a locker and an envelope in our register form.




----
------
Now we'll add validation logic to `src/cljc/visitera/validation.cljs`

```clojure
(ns visitera.validation
  (:require [struct.core :as st]))

(def register-schema
  [[:email
    st/required
    st/string
    st/email]

   [:password
    st/required
    st/string
    {:message "password must contain at least 8 characters"
     :validate #(> (count %) 7)}]])

(defn validate-register [params]
  (first (st/validate params register-schema)))
```

Because it's located in `cljc` folder it can be shared between client and server. The code by itself is pretty straightforward. We need to check that email and password exist and both are strings, for email we use default email validation, and for password check if it's more than 7 characters.
