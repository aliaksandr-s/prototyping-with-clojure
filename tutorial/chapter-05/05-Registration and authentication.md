# Registration and authentication

By now our app has a data layer so we can start working on our backed service. In this chapter we will have a look at some theory behind registration and authentication, implement routes and handlers and add some tests.

Code for the beginning of this chapter can be found in  `app/chapter-05/start` folder.
